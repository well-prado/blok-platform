title: Deploy
---

The `nanoctl deploy` command publishes a compiled nanoservice to the NanoServices platform, making it available for execution within your workflows. You can deploy an already-built artifact or let the CLI handle the build process automatically using the `--build` flag.

This command is flexible enough to support local development, production deployments, and integration into CI/CD pipelines. It allows you to define the service name, source directory, and whether to trigger a build as part of deploymentâ€”all through a straightforward CLI interface.

Whether you're deploying from the current directory, a specific build path, or as part of an automated script, `nanoctl deploy` provides a consistent, reliable way to push your nanoservice live.

## Deploy Blok 

### Syntax
```bash
npx nanoctl deploy [options]
```


 Deploys a nanoservice to the NanoServices platform, optionally building it first.
 
**Options:**
 - `--name`, `-n` (string): Service name (required). Default: none.
 - `--build` (boolean): Build before deploying. Default: false.
 - `--directory`, `-d` (string): Source directory path. Default: Current working directory.
 - `--help`, `-h` (boolean): Show help. Default: false.
 
**Commands:**
 - `.`: Deploy from the current directory.

### Examples

#### Deploy with build:
```bash
npx nanoctl deploy -n my-service --build
```

#### Deploy existing build:
```bash
npx nanoctl deploy -n my-service -d ./build-output
```

#### Deploy from current directory:
```bash
npx nanoctl deploy -n my-service .
```

# Build and Deploy Example

#### Build and deploy workflow:
```bash
# Build first
npx nanoctl build -d ./src

# Then deploy
npx nanoctl deploy -n my-service -d ./src
```

#### Single-command build & deploy:
```bash
npx nanoctl deploy -n my-service --build
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Example:
```bash
# In your deployment script
npx nanoctl build -d $CODE_DIR
npx nanoctl deploy -n $SERVICE_NAME -d $CODE_DIR
```
