# Active Context - Blok Community Platform

## Current Project State

### Analysis Phase Complete
We have completed a comprehensive analysis of the project documentation and requirements:
- âœ… **PRD Analysis**: Reviewed 743-line comprehensive Product Requirements Document
- âœ… **Blok Framework Understanding**: Deep dive into framework architecture and capabilities
- âœ… **Technical Stack Assessment**: Current dependencies and missing components identified
- âœ… **Memory Bank Initialization**: Core documentation structure established

### Key Insights Discovered

**Blok Framework Core Concepts**
- **Nodes**: Self-contained, reusable logic units with clear inputs/outputs
- **Workflows**: JSON/YAML/TOML definitions that orchestrate node execution
- **Context (CTX)**: Shared execution object carrying parameters, I/O, and metadata
- **Multi-Runtime**: Node.js primary, Python/Bun in development
- **CLI-First**: `nanoctl` tool for project management and development

**Current Platform Status**
- **Backend Foundation**: Blok framework with basic Express server
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL and MongoDB clients available
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI provider present
- **Missing Critical Components**: Frontend implementation, Redis caching, community features

## Current Focus Areas

### Immediate Priority: Platform Foundation
We need to establish the core platform foundation following Blok framework patterns:

1. **Node-Based API Development** ðŸ”„ **CRITICAL PATTERN**
   - Create custom nodes for all API functionality (users, workflows, community)
   - Organize nodes in folders under `src/nodes/`
   - Register all custom nodes in `Nodes.ts`
   - NO traditional REST controllers - everything via Blok workflows

2. **Workflow-Driven Endpoints** ðŸ”„ **CRITICAL PATTERN**  
   - Each JSON workflow file = one API endpoint
   - Filename becomes endpoint: `users.json` â†’ `localhost:4000/users`
   - Always use path: "/" unless expecting parameters
   - Store all workflows in `/workflows/json/` folder

3. **Frontend Application Setup**
   - React 18 with TypeScript
   - Vite build system for optimal development experience
   - Tailwind CSS for styling system
   - Zustand for state management
   - React Query for server state

4. **Database Schema Design**
   - PostgreSQL schemas for users, workflows, community data
   - MongoDB collections for workflow definitions and metadata
   - Redis integration for caching and sessions

### Active Technical Decisions

**Frontend Architecture Decision: Micro-Frontend vs Monolithic**
- **Decision**: Start with monolithic React app for faster initial development
- **Rationale**: Team size and complexity don't justify micro-frontend overhead initially
- **Future Path**: Migrate to micro-frontends during Phase 3 when team scales

**State Management Decision: Zustand + React Query**
- **Decision**: Use Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **Rationale**: Minimal boilerplate, excellent TypeScript support, proven performance
- **Alternative Considered**: Redux Toolkit (rejected due to complexity)

**Database Strategy Decision: Polyglot Persistence**
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL (relational), MongoDB (documents), Redis (cache)
- **Rationale**: Each technology optimized for specific data patterns
- **Trade-off**: Increased operational complexity vs performance optimization

## Recent Changes and Updates

### Memory Bank Structure Established
- **projectbrief.md**: Core project definition and objectives
- **productContext.md**: Problem space and solution approach
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture patterns and design decisions
- **techContext.md**: Technology stack and constraints
- **activeContext.md**: Current state and active work (this document)

### Project Understanding Enhanced
- **Competitive Landscape**: Clear differentiation from n8n, Zapier, Power Automate
- **User Personas**: Backend developers, DevOps engineers, data scientists
- **AI Integration**: OpenManus agents for natural language workflow generation
- **Community Features**: Reputation systems, collaborative editing, content sharing

## Next Steps and Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation (Next 4 Weeks)

**Week 1: Development Environment Setup**
- [ ] Frontend React application with Vite
- [ ] Docker compose for local development services
- [ ] Database schemas and initial migrations
- [ ] Basic authentication and user management

**Week 2: Core API Development**
- [ ] User registration and authentication endpoints
- [ ] Workflow CRUD operations
- [ ] Basic search functionality
- [ ] API documentation with OpenAPI

**Week 3: Frontend Core Features**
- [ ] Authentication UI (login, register)
- [ ] Basic workflow browser/discovery
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Responsive layout and navigation

**Week 4: Integration and Testing**
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration
- [ ] End-to-end user workflows
- [ ] Basic security testing
- [ ] Performance baseline establishment

### Upcoming Decisions Needed

**Authentication Provider Strategy**
- **Question**: Which OAuth providers to support initially?
- **Options**: GitHub (developer-focused), Google (broad appeal), both
- **Timeline**: Decision needed by end of Week 1
- **Dependencies**: Frontend login UI design

**AI Integration Scope for Phase 1**
- **Question**: How much OpenManus integration for initial release?
- **Options**: Basic chat only, simple generation, full generation
- **Timeline**: Decision needed by end of Week 2
- **Dependencies**: OpenManus API stability and documentation

**Atomic-Canvas Integration Approach**
- **Question**: Embed existing canvas or build custom visualization?
- **Options**: NPM package, iframe embed, custom React components
- **Timeline**: Decision needed by start of Phase 2
- **Dependencies**: Atomic-canvas team coordination

## Active Challenges and Blockers

### Technical Challenges

**Multi-Runtime Node Execution**
- **Challenge**: Supporting Python and Bun nodes in browser environment
- **Impact**: Affects workflow preview and testing capabilities
- **Potential Solutions**: Server-side preview, sandboxed execution, mock modes
- **Owner**: Backend team decision needed

**Real-Time Collaboration**
- **Challenge**: Multiple users editing workflows simultaneously
- **Impact**: Core differentiator vs competitors
- **Potential Solutions**: Operational Transforms, CRDT, lock-based editing
- **Owner**: Research phase required

**AI Response Streaming**
- **Challenge**: Progressive workflow generation with user feedback
- **Impact**: User experience quality for AI features
- **Potential Solutions**: WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, polling
- **Owner**: Frontend architecture decision

### Resource Constraints

**Team Composition**
- **Current**: Single developer (analysis phase)
- **Needed**: 4-6 developers for Phase 1 (full-stack, frontend, backend, DevOps)
- **Timeline**: Team assembly needed before implementation begins

**Infrastructure Budget**
- **Current**: Development environment costs
- **Needed**: Production-grade services for testing and staging
- **Timeline**: Budget approval needed for cloud resources

## Success Criteria for Current Phase

### Development Environment Success
- [ ] Local development running with single command
- [ ] All services (DB, Redis, API, Frontend) communicating
- [ ] Hot reload working for both frontend and backend
- [ ] Basic authentication flow functional

### Foundation Architecture Success
- [ ] API following RESTful principles with OpenAPI docs
- [ ] Database schemas supporting core user and workflow entities
- [ ] Frontend components following atomic design principles
- [ ] Security middleware protecting authenticated endpoints

### Integration Success
- [ ] User can register, login, and manage profile
- [ ] User can view and search existing workflows
- [ ] Basic workflow metadata display functional
- [ ] Error handling and validation working end-to-end

This foundation phase is critical for establishing development velocity and architectural patterns that will support the full platform vision.
